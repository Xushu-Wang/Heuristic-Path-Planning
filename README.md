# Heuristic Path Planning

## Overview

Heuristic Path Planning is a comprehensive Python repository dedicated to exploring various heuristic algorithms for automated path planning. Developed as a Course Project for CS 634 (Geometric Algorithms), this project implements a diverse set of algorithms to solve path planning problems, leveraging the power of heuristics to optimize solutions.

### Core Features:

- **A\* Algorithm**: An implementation of the classic pathfinding and graph traversal algorithm, optimized with custom heuristics.
- **Probabilistic Roadmap (PRM)**: A method for high-dimensional planning that uses a graph of possible paths.
- **Rapidly-exploring Random Trees (RRT)**: Includes various versions of the RRT algorithm to explore complex spaces rapidly.
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combines PRM and A\* for efficient path planning in structured and unstructured environments.
- **Custom Heuristic Functions**: Enables dynamic adaptation of heuristic strategies for specific planning scenarios.
- **Utility Functions**: A collection of utilities for obstacle creation, path visualization, and algorithm evaluation.

## Requirements

Before running the Heuristic Path Planning scripts, ensure you have the following prerequisites:

- Python 3.6 or higher
- PyTorch 2.1.0 or higher
- NumPy for mathematical computations
